![2013 NYC Taxi data aggregated](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/blob/master/header.PNG?raw=true)
The [__GIS Tools for Hadoop__](http://esri.github.io/gis-tools-for-hadoop/) are a collection of GIS tools that leverage 
the [Spatial Framework for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop)
for spatial analysis of big data.  The tools make use of 
the [Geoprocessing Tools for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/geoprocessing-tools-for-hadoop) toolbox,
to provide access to the Hadoop system from the ArcGIS Geoprocessing environment.

**Resources for building custom tools**

* [Esri Geometry API Java](https://github.com/Esri/geometry-api-java) - Java geometry library for spatial data 
processing 
* [Spatial Framework for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop) 
  * Java helper utilities for Hadoop developers
  * Hive spatial user-defined functions 
* [Geoprocessing Tools](https://github.com/Esri/geoprocessing-tools-for-hadoop) - ArcGIS Geoprocessing tools 
for Hadoop


## Instructions

Start out by navigating to [samples](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/tree/master/samples) and 
following the instructions provided with each sample.[There are also tutorials](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/wiki) for using the GP tools and aggregation methods.

## Requirements

Requirements will differ depending on the needs of each tool. At a minimum, you will need:

* Access to an [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) cluster
* [ArcGIS for Desktop](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop) or 
[Server](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver) for geoprocessing and visualization

Other requirements may include:

* [Apache Hive](http://hive.apache.org/) in order to run Hive queries
* [Apache Oozie Workflow Scheduler](http://oozie.apache.org/) for workflow scheduling

Additional requirements will be spelled out by individual tools.
