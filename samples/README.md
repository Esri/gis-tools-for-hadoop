## Sample Tools

These sample tools are provided as references for building custom spatial tools. We currently have three samples, two of which use MapReduce algorithms, while one uses Hive:

1. To try out a point in polygon aggregation using hive with global earthquake data and California county polygons, try the [point-in-polygon-aggregation-hive](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/tree/master/samples/point-in-polygon-aggregation-hive) sample. 

2. To try out a point in polygon aggregation using a custom MapReduce job with global earthquake data and California county polygons, try the [point-in-polygon-aggregation-mr](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/tree/master/samples/point-in-polygon-aggregation-mr) sample. 

3. To complete the sample MapReduce algorithm used in the [Vehicle Trip Discovery case study](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/wiki/Vehicle-Trip-Discovery-with-GIS-Tools-for-Hadoop), use the [trip-discovery](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/tree/master/samples/trip-discovery) sample.

After completing a sample and becoming comfortable with the framework, you can complete the [tutorials](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/wiki), or work on building your own custom tools.
